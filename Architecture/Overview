The setup consists of multiple services deployed in a single network (bigdata_network) to enable seamless communication. Below is a high-level description of the components and their relationships:

1. Zookeeper
Purpose: Provides coordination and service discovery for distributed systems.
Ports: Exposes port 2181 for client connections.
Role: Serves as a dependency for Kafka and Drill, ensuring distributed consensus.

2. Kafka
Purpose: A distributed event streaming platform for message brokering.
Configuration:
Connects to Zookeeper (zookeeper:2181) for coordination.
Uses PLAINTEXT communication mode.
Ports: Exposes port 9092 for producer and consumer communication.
Depends On: Zookeeper for its operation.
Role: Provides a messaging layer for big data pipelines.

3. Hadoop Cluster
Components:
Hadoop Namenode:
Purpose: Manages metadata for the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
Ports:
9870: Web UI for HDFS.
9000: RPC for file system operations.
Volumes: Stores namenode metadata in namenode_data.
Role: Central point for HDFS.
Hadoop Datanode:
Purpose: Stores the actual data blocks for HDFS.
Ports:
9864: Web UI for the datanode.
Volumes: Stores data blocks in datanode_data.
Depends On: Namenode for operation.
Role: Provides distributed storage for big data.

4. Delta-Spark
Purpose: Provides an Apache Spark runtime with Delta Lake capabilities.
Configuration:
Configured with 2 cores and 4GB of memory for Spark workers.
Runs in standalone mode (spark://delta-spark:7077).
Includes a custom scripts directory mounted at /opt/spark/work-dir/scripts.
Ports: Exposes port 4040 for Spark UI.
Depends On:
Kafka: Likely used as a source or sink for Spark data processing.
Hadoop Namenode: Accesses HDFS for reading/writing Delta tables.
Role: Executes distributed data processing and manages Delta Lake transactions.

5. Apache Drill
Purpose: Distributed SQL query engine for querying structured and semi-structured data.
Configuration:
Connects to Zookeeper (zookeeper:2181) for coordination.
Uses HDFS (hdfs://namenode:8020) as a storage backend.
Configuration files mounted from the host at /opt/drill/setup.
Ports:
8047: Web UI for Drill.
31010: RPC port for Drill queries.
Depends On:
Zookeeper for coordination.
Hadoop Namenode for HDFS storage.
Role: Enables SQL-based querying on HDFS and other data sources.

6. MongoDB
Purpose: A NoSQL database for storing semi-structured or unstructured data.
Configuration:
Initializes a database named agri_data.
Ports: Exposes port 27017 for database connections.
Role: Acts as a data source or sink for applications needing document-oriented storage.


Networking
All services communicate via a single bridge network (bigdata_network), ensuring isolation and interconnectivity.
